ğŸ”¢ Random Number Generator and Classifier

A Java-based program that generates a specified number of random numbers, classifies them into even and odd arrays, sorts them in different orders, and displays the results.

ğŸ’¡ Features
1. Prompt User for Number of Random Numbers: The program prompts the user to input how many random numbers they would like to generate.
2. Parse and Validate Input: Ensures that the user's input is valid (a positive integer).
3. Generate Random Numbers: Random numbers are generated based on the user's input.
4. Classify Numbers into Even and Odd Arrays: The numbers are classified into two arrays: one for even numbers and another for odd numbers.
5. Sort Arrays:
   - The even numbers are sorted in ascending order.
   - The odd numbers are sorted in descending order.
6. Display Results: Display the even and odd numbers after classification and sorting.
7. Error Handling: The program handles invalid input and out-of-memory errors gracefully.
